# CONTRIBUTING

## How to contribute

---

Thanks for reading this because I are always looking to collaborate with other people to see their ideas.

To get started fork the repo and make a branch with an accurate name for the changes you are making. Once you have made the changes to your liking open a pull request and I will look it over.

## Documentation

---

All changes should be documented using restructuredText both with docstring and in [docs](../docs) for readthedoc. If you need help with it then please let me know.


## Testing

---

All new changes should have tests cases when possible. New changes should also not break existing tests.
